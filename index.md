## Up & Down Mood Tracking App & Sensor 

“Up & Down” is a mood-tracking app where users are able to track their mood by selecting emojis & words to describe how they’re feeling. The app also integrates physiological data from custom physiological sensors such as the EmotiBit & Galvanic Skin Response/Electrodermal activity, which are closely related to emotions.
